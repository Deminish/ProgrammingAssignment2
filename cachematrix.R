## Title: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Description: Solve the inverse of matrices, cachine results to save
## on computation

## Create a special matrix that can cache it's inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Compute the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix
## If the inverse has already been calculated then retrieve the inverse
## from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
